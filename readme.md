# Information About the Files...

# OLD DATA FOLDERS... (data_v1,data_v2,data_v3)
The files in v1 was primarly testing if the spin flips would result in an expected magnetization behavior in the graphs when done over many montecarlo steps. Additonally v2 is the introduction of parallel tempering to see if we still result in the expected magentization behaviors while also allowing the lower temperatures to consider other spin configurations. V3 simply builds off of v2 by extending it into 3d.

# Metropolis Implementations in Python (pythonMulti, pythonSingle)
Both of these files use the same functions, with single being the first implementation prior to an attempt in parallelization using threads library in pythonMulti. Still remained slow and the for loops were not as efficient, though 
possible reconstruction of the program may result in faster data generation. These two folders work but were not used in the final implementation.

# Spinglass_metropolis.c++
This file is the main file for generating our data. It is somewhat parallel though the structure could be improved on.

# VAE+CNN.ipynb
This file takes in the raw data generated by the Spinglass_metropolis.c++ file and further processes it into a cleaner dataframe. This file also makes the vae+cnn deeplearning model and trains it over the further cleaned dataframe to see if the latent variables, mean and varience for different temperatures, appear to resemble some critical point when graphed.
